        <p>Steak and potatoes is a classic and very simple recipe. It consists of two simple yet delectable ingredients as the star with a few other minor ones playing supporting, but nevertheless essential roles. A fantastic cut of steak
            and diced potatoes is all that technically goes into the dish, but as we said, a few enhances are added to make this a winner.</p>
        <p>Before we can start, you must decide on the flavor profile you would like for your steak and potatoes. You can go from the savoriness of creole and ranch seasoning, to the sweetness of caramelized onions and <em>Herbes de Provence.</em>
         The recipe is versatile enough to adapt to the taste you prefer.</p>
         <p>For our purposes, we will be using a simple recipe consisting of garlic, salt, pepper and truffle oil. It is by no means extravagant, but it does not make it any less tasty.</p>
         
         <h4>Ingredients!</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
                <li>Truff Olive Oil (Black Truffles)</li>
                <li>1/2 Stick of Salted Butter</li>
                <li>1 Pound of Yukon Gold Potatoes</li>
                <li>Minced Garlic (Preferrably minced by you)</li>
                <li>Dried Rosemary</li>
                <li>Dried Oregano</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
                <li>Flat Iron Steak</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps!</h4>
        <h5>Prep Work!</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Take your meat and your butter out of the fridge and allow them to sit for a bit. This will make the butter softer and easier to work with.</li>
                <li>Dice your potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes, you can go bigger, but it's not recommended. The bigger they are the longer they take to cook.</li>
                <li>Some would prefer the steak not be diced, and frankly, that is up to you. This recipe, however, calls for dicing the meat into 1/2 inch steaks. When diced, toss them with salt, pepper and a little bit of olive oil</li>

                <li>If you decided to mince your own garlic, now is the time to mince.</li>
                <li>Heat your pan (Invest in a cast iron skillet if you have not already done so) over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and half your butter.</li>
            </ol>
        <h5>Actual Cooking!</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Now that your skillet is heated up, toss your potatoes in with the garlic, rosemary, oregano and pepper. You want to allow the potatoes to cook for 4-5 minutes without bothering them. Then you begin to stir them al together.
                 At this point add the Truffle oil. Keep stirring for another 4-5 minutes and fork the potatoes until they are tender. <strong>Note:</strong> if your potatoes are still undercooked, you may add a bit of water and cover the 
                skillet, the steam will help the potatoes cook through. Once the potatoes are cooked fully, remove them from the skillet and put them down in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Put the Skillet back on the stove, set the heat to high and add the rest of your butter, stirring it to make sure it fully melts. Before the butter burns, add your diced steak bites in a single layer across the pan and
                    cook for one minute. You want to then flip the steak around and cook for another 1-2 minutes or at least until the meat is to your liking just make sure it ain't raw. Then remove the skillet from heat.</li>
                <li>Finally, add the potatoes into into the skillet and toss together, add some more salt, pepper and maybe just a bit more of truffle oil. If you believe in extra greenery, top the skillet with chopped parsley.</li>
