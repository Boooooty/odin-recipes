        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Grandma Ken's Lasagna is a scrumptious, cheesy and mouth-watering pasta dish. It's made with traditional NON-italian ingredients meaning that what traditions it follows? Not even Grandma Ken knows because it's just a marketing word.
             This delicious dish requires a bit of prep work, but the end result is well worth it and it will keep you fed for days, even though we know you made this only for yourself, you fat loser. Try not to think too much about it as you look at your
             obese reflection on the oven door.

        <h4>Steps!</h4>
            <h5>Initial prep</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fill a large pot with water and add a lot of salt. Then set it on the Stove and bring it to a boil. Add Lasagna noodles and cook according to the box. </li>

Height="480" width="480">
                    
                    <li>Once they're done, grab an entire lasagna noodle and slam it against the wall to ensure it is <em>Al Dente</em> or whatever other pretentious term for done there is. If you don't do this, they'll be gross and soggy when they get 
                        to the oven. Drain and drizzle them in olive oil and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Preheat Oven to 375 Degrees. Sorry bro, you can't do this on an air fryer.</li>
                    <li>Start Chopping Garlic and Onions, Smaller = better here. Wash all your other vegetables and begin to cut the mushrooms and carrots as well</li>

                </ol>
            <h5>Sauce Making!</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large pot, throw 3/5ths of that stick of salted butter and make sure its on a medium-high heat. Do not let the butter brown. Throw in the garlic and onics and cook until the onions are translucent.</li>
                    <li>Add mushrooms and carrots to the mix with salt and pepper. Now you can throw in those fennel seeds you would likely have never bought otherwise. Mushrooms will begin to release moisture and you're gonna let it cook
                        until there's at least half of it left.</li>
                    <li>Add the cans of tomatoes and stir vigorously.</li>
                    <li>Now you can add the rest of that butter along with the red wine, salt, pepper and just a tiny bit of nutmeg(optional).</li>
                    <li>Stir everything together and reduce the heat to medium, leave it to simmer and stir it occasionally.</li>
                </ol>
            <h5>Other Ingredient Prep!</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat up a skillet. Remove the sausage casings and toss into the skilled along with the ground beef and a little bit of olive oil. Be sure to give them a proper mash with a spoon until they're cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Wash and cut all of your herbs, that is to say:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Parsley</li>
                                <li>Rosemary</li>
                                <li>Basil</li>
                            </ul>
                    <li>In a bowl, add all of your Ricotta and Mozzarella and about half of your shredded cheeses. Crack and drop the eggs in along with pepper and stir it all together so they get to know each other in the bowl</li>
                    <li>Once the meat is finished and the cheese is thoroughly cooked, you can remove the sauce from the heat</li>
                </ol>
            <h5>Assemble The Lasagna!</h5>

                <ol>
                    <li>In a 10x14 Pan, layer the ingredients in the following order: Noodle, cheese, meat, sauce and repeat until out of all the ingredients. You can layer however you want, but you're making something else if you do and
                        we're not here for cowboy lasagnas. This is as authentic as carbonara with bacon. There is no need to flood the noodle with cheese, just a good even spread and it should melt evenly. Use a dish under the pan just 
                        in case it spills over it doesn't make a mess in the oven, if your roommate is a crybaby this will save you a headache.</li>
                    <li>Upon reaching the final layer, top it with cheese AND the shredded cheese you had set aside.</li>
                    <li>Throw the herbs you set aside on top of the lasagna</li>
                    <li>Throw into your preheated oven for about 45 minutes. When the cheese begins to bubble and turn into a mouth-watering golden brown on top</li>
                    <li>At this point you can remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Cut up two pieces because you have no self-control or notion of what is an appropriate portion and enjoy!</li>
