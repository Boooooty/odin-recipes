        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken in Mushroom sauce is one of my favorite dishes. It is extremely savory and the hints of earthiness from the mushrooms make the savoriness not feel as overwhelming. Chicken is the perfect canvas for this dish as the sauce 
            is essentially the star! The chicken's flavor is not overpowering and is the perfect place to display the greatness of this sauce.</p>
        
        
        <h4>Ingredients!</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken Breasts</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Mushroom</li>
                <li>Parmesan</li>
                <li>Chicken Broth</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Cream</li>
                <li>White Wine</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <h3>Initial Prep</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut your Chicken breasts in half. Let's be real, they're pretty big. If you pair with a side dish, cutting a chicken breast in half is two meals. You want to then pound the meat in order to have a more even cooking area</li>
                <li>Clean, dry and then slice your mushrooms. the thinner the slices, the better. There is no need to dice them. simple slicing will suffice.</li>
                <li>Use just salt and pepper to season your chicken. After making sure the breasts are well seasoned, dust them in flour. You are not coating them! this is simply done for texture, you are not breading the chicken.</li>
                <li>Mince your garlic. There is an endless debate as to whether the trouble of mincing garlic is worth it compared buying already minced garlic, I am inclined to still mince my own garlic, but oftentimes I'm just lazy.</li>
                <li>Hopefully, you got real Parmesan and not that powdered Kraft garbage. If you did, shred your parmesan and set it aside.</li>
                <li>Preheat a pan and toss butter into it. 2 tablespoons is enough</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Actual Cooking!</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>With your pan already heated, you want to start with the chicken. Put the chicken into the hot butter until it is golden and crispy. If you hammered the chicken and made it thin, 2 minutes should be enough. At that point
                    you want to remove your chicken and set it aside.</li>
                <li>Now toss the rest of your butter into the pan and wait for it to fully melt, then toss in your mushrooms. Cook your mushrooms until they are golden, at that point add your garlic into the pan. It is important you <strong>do not</strong>>
                    toss your garlic in too early or it will burn.</li>
                <li>Now comes the snooty part. Add the white wine, a 1/4 cup will do. This is called <em>deglazing</em> and it's used to make sure the food at the bottom of the pan does not stick and joins the rest of the sauce you're trying to make. 
                    Let it simmer as that will cook out the alcohol and dissolve the bits at the bottom to create the <em>fond</em>.</li>
                <li>Once the particulate at the bottom of the pan has dissolved and mixed in, add the cream and then the parmesan. Then let it simmer for a few minutes. While the original recipe does not call for it, you can add a little bit of
                    flour at this stage in order to help thicken the mushroom sauce even more. Once thickened properly, put the chicken back on the pan and baste it with the sauce so it is submerged. Allow it to warm.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You can enjoy this dish with vegetables, rice, roasted potatoes or mashed potatoes. The sauce goes great on everything.</p>
